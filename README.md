# Collegemate
Collegemate is a web application built specially for a flawless
          sharing of materials and remainders between students and staff
          members without having to share personal contact credentials. This
          helps students to greatly manage their schedule and the work they
          have. This is not yet another Google Classroom. Unlike any other
          online learning platforms, this is not designed for
          #StudyFromHome. The Collegemate app is designed to work during
          days of on field education only. The app is mainly focused on
          managing all the works, assignments, home works and digital
          materials with ease, without having to manually manage stuff.
